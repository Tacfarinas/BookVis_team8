# Visualizing Readme Data - Team 8

The goal of our project is to give visual representation to a user's library as it was exported from Goodreads, using seaborn visualizations and/or D3 visualizations. 

Later version will allow for a user to import their own Goodreads data to view various intuitive visual representations.


### Prerequisites

Below are some ofthe python packages that will be required. 

```
seaborn
pandas
wordcloud
scikit-learn
```

## Relationship plots 

The relationships of interest to be visualized are currently:
* plot Pages vs Ratings
* plot Ratings vs Bookshelves
* Plot books read by year
* plot Heatmap of dates read
* plot Word Cloud

More to come in the future!

### TO-DO List
